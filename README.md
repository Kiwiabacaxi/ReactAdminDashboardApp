# React Admin Dashboard App

## Overview

Welcome to the React Admin Dashboard App project! This is a practical undertaking as part of my computer engineering studies, inspired by the tutorial by [EdRoh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYpCWwD1oz0). The primary focus is on building a robust admin dashboard using React, Material UI, and other modern technologies.

## Key Features

- **React Framework:** Leveraging the efficiency of the React library for dynamic user interface development.

- **Material UI:** Crafting a modern and responsive design using the stylized components from Material UI.
